# Pwnagotchi AutoBackup Plugin

This plugin allows you to automatically back up important files on your Pwnagotchi device. It supports both local and remote backups via rsync over SSH.

## Features
- **Automatic Backups:** Periodically backs up files to a local or remote server.
- **Local and Remote Backup:** Specify a local directory and a remote SSH server to store backups.
- **Architecture-Aware:** Detects whether your system is 32-bit or 64-bit and adjusts the backup files accordingly.

## Requirements
- **Pwnagotchi:** Installed on a Raspberry Pi.
- **SSH Key:** Required for remote backups.
- **Internet Access:** To download the plugin and perform remote backups.

## Installation

### Step 1: Create an SSH Key
To perform remote backups, youâ€™ll need to create an SSH key that the Pwnagotchi can use to connect to the remote server.

1. Generate the SSH key (on your Pwnagotchi):
   `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key -N ""`

2. Copy the SSH public key to your remote server:
   `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key.pub user@remotehost`  
   Replace `user@remotehost` with your remote server's username and IP address.

### Step 2: Set Up SSH Key for GitHub
Add the SSH key (`~/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key.pub`) to your GitHub account under Settings > SSH and GPG keys.

Then
`nano ~/.ssh/config`

```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key
```

And finally run these commands

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Result should be 
`Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.`




Use the following command to display the key:  
`cat ~/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key.pub`  
Make sure to copy the output to your clipboard.

### Step 3: Create a Private GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
2. Click the + icon in the upper right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., **Backup**).
4. Select **Private** to keep your repository secure.
5. Click **Create repository**.

### Step 4: Install the AutoBackup Plugin
Download the installation script to your Pwnagotchi:  
`wget https://github.com/wpa-2/pwny_backup/raw/main/install_autobackup.sh -O install_autobackup.sh`  

Make the script executable:  
`chmod +x install_autobackup.sh`  

Run the installation script:  
`sudo ./install_autobackup.sh`  

The script will:
- Check the permissions of your SSH key.
- Prompt for the local and remote backup paths.
- Test your SSH connection to the remote server.
- Download the `autobackup.py` plugin and install it.
- Update the Pwnagotchi configuration file with the required plugin configuration.

### Step 5: Configure the Plugin
During the installation, you'll be prompted to enter:
- **Local Backup Path:** Directory on the Pwnagotchi where local backups will be stored.
- **Remote Backup:** The SSH connection string for the remote server (e.g., `user@remotehost:/path/to/backup`).

### Example configuration in `config.toml`:

Autobackup Plugin Configuration
```
main.plugins.autobackup.github_repo = "git@github.com:username/repository.git"
main.plugins.autobackup.github_backup_dir = "Backups"
main.plugins.autobackup.remote_backup = "user@LOCALIP:/path/to/folder/,/home/pi/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key"
main.plugins.autobackup.enabled = true
main.plugins.autobackup.interval = 1  # Backup every 1 hour
main.plugins.autobackup.max_tries = 3
main.plugins.autobackup.local_backup_path = "/home/pi/backup/"`
```

### Step 6: Verify Installation
Restart Pwnagotchi to apply the changes:  
`sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi`  

Check the logs to verify the plugin is running:  
`pwnlog`  
You should see log entries indicating that the backup process is scheduled and running.

## Backup Frequency
The backup interval is set in the configuration file. Adjust it based on your needs; for example, a 1-hour interval might be suitable for regular backups, while longer intervals may suffice for less critical data.

## Security Considerations
Ensure your SSH keys are kept secure. Do not share your private key, and consider using passphrases for added security.

## Contact/Support Information
If you encounter issues, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wpa-2/pwny_backup/issues).

## Changelog
- **Version x.0:** Initial release.

## Troubleshooting
- **SSH Connection Issues:** Ensure that the SSH key has been properly configured and that the Pwnagotchi can connect to the remote server without needing a password:
   `ssh -i /home/pi/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key user@remotehost`  
   `ssh -T git@github.com`

- **Permissions:** Ensure the SSH key file has the correct permissions:
```
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/pwnagotchi_backup_key.pub
```

- **Logs:** Check the Pwnagotchi logs for any errors or issues with the backup process:  
   `pwnlog`

  ## Known issues
  
Some times this shows as an error (not really an issue if your using pwny a lot and its not sat in manu mode)

`14:21:43 [ERROR] AUTO_BACKUP: Git command 'cd /home/pi/backup/Backups && git commit -m 'Backup on 2024-09-21 14:21:43.157731'' failed with exit code 1`

Just means the backup hasnt changed and theres nothing new to upload, i need to fix that at some point.
